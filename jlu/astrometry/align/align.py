def match(x1, y1, m1, x2, y2, m2, dr_tol, dm_tol=None):
    """
    Finds matches between two different catalogs. No transformations are done and it
    is assumed that the two catalogs are already on the same coordinate system
    and magnitude system.

    For two stars to be matched, they must be within a specified radius (dr_tol) and
    delta-magnitude (dm_tol). For stars with more than 1 neighbor (within the tolerances),
    if one is found that is the best match in both brightness and positional offsets
    (closest in both), then the match is made. Otherwise,
    their is a conflict and no match is returned for the star.
    
 
    Parameters
    x1 : array-like
        X coordinate in the first catalog
    y1 : array-like
        Y coordinate in the first catalog (shape of array must match `x1`)
    m1 : array-like
        Magnitude in the first catalog. Must have the same shape as x1.
    x2 : array-like
        X coordinate in the second catalog
    y2 : array-like
        Y coordinate in the second catalog (shape of array must match `x2`)
    m2 : array-like
        Magnitude in the second catalog. Must have the same shape as x2.
    dr_tol : float
        How close (in units of the first catalog) a match has to be to count as a match.
        For stars with more than one nearest neighbor, the delta-magnitude is checked
        and the closest in delta-mag is chosen.
    dm_tol : float or None, optional
        How close in delta-magnitude a match has to be to count as a match.
        If None, then any delta-magnitude is allowed.
 
    Returns
    -------
    idx1 : int array
        Indicies into the first catalog of the matches. Will never be
        larger than `x1`/`y1`.
    idx2 : int array
        Indicies into the second catalog of the matches. Will never be
        larger than `x1`/`y1`.
    dr : float array
        Distance between the matches.
    dm : float array
        Delta-mag between the matches. (m1 - m2)
